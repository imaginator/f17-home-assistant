# Integration of Xiaomi Vacuum Cleaner
#
# Tips:
# - Increasing the x coordinate will move the robot relative to the starting point to the right
#   (decreasing to the left)
# - Increasing the y coordinate will move the robot relative to the starting point to the top
#   (decreasing to the bottom)
# - To serach key coordinates, use the service "vacuum.send_command" in GUI with the
#   parameters below. You can check on the Mi app to see where is the target:
# {
#  "entity_id": "vacuum.rocky",
#  "command": "app_goto_target",
#  "params": [25500,25600]
# }
#
# Usefull coordinates:
#  - dock: [25500,25500]
